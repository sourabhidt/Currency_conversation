## Getting Started

### Dependency Management

#### CocoaPods

In project, Assuming cocoapods is installed, if not Install it like so:

    sudo gem install cocoapods


This creates a Podfile, which will hold all dependencies in one place. After adding your dependencies to the Podfile, run

    pod install

to install the libraries and include them as part of a workspace.
Note that from now on, you'll need to open the `.xcworkspace` file instead of `.xcproject`, or your code will not compile. The command

    pod update
